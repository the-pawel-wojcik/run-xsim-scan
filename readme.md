# xsim scripts 
Prepare, submit, pull, and plot a series of calculations that scans a
paramerter in the KDC model. Support for xsim (part of CFOUR) and xsimplot.py.

For plotting, place an `xsimplot.toml` config file in the scan subdirectory.

## Usage
1. Create a directory and place there an input for xsim with an extension
`.template`.
2. git clone this this repository to that directory
```bash
git clone git@github.com:the-pawel-wojcik/run-xsim-scan
```
3. Hardlink scripts in the cwd
```bash
for file in run-xsim-scan/src/* ; do ln $file; done
```
4. Edit the `.template` file by replacing the value you would like to scan with 
`TEMPLATE_<NAME>`. Where the list of avalilbe `<NAME>` value can be checked in
`get_template_name.sh` script.
5. Adjust the range of scanned parameter by editing the `run-spawn.sh` scritp.
6. Issue 
```bash
./run-spawn.sh
./push.sh  # read this file and the trick below to get it to work
```
7. The input files are now on your cluster â€“ submit them.
8. Once the jobs finish get the results back on your machine with
```bash
./pull.sh
```
9. View the results with
```bash
./plot.sh
```
Create an `xsimplot.toml` file in the `scan` directory to customize the plot.

## User and domain trick in push/pull scripts
Here is how to avoid typing 
```bash
ssh user@host.domain
```

1. Set an alias in `/etc/hosts`, i.e., a line like this
```
127.0.0.1 hpc
```
You can find your server's ip with 
```bash
nslookup <host.domain>
```

2. In `~/.ssh/config` set the default user for your cluster
```
Host hpc
  User <user>
```

With these two changes you can now simply
```bash
ssh hpc
```
The same goes for `rsync`.
